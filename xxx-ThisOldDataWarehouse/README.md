# What The Hack - ThisOldDataWarehouse
Modern Data Warehouse What the Hack

## Introduction

Modern Data Warehouse is a key upgrade motion for organizations to scale out their on-premise analytical workloads to the cloud.  This hack will help data engineers and administrators upgrade their skills to migrate to Azure Synapse Analytics. The hack will be the sequential migration steps required to migrate from on-premise to Synapse Analytics and re-platform attached workloads like ETL and reporting.


## Learning Objectives

In this hack, data engineers will learn how to migrate their platform to the cloud (data, schema and code).  Additionally, they need to build out Data Warehouse architectures that can scale for large data volumes, different data structures and real-time ingestions.  Azure Synapse Analytics provides all these capabilities as an integrated platform and we'll help you better understand how to refactor your existing data warehouse to Azure.  
1. Modern Data Warehouse Architecture
1. Azure Synapse Decision Tree
1. Refactor T-SQL code to be compatible with Synapse
1. ETL/ELT design patterns and how to build them with ADF + ADLS
1. Setup a streaming data pipeline with Kafka
1. Tune Synapse for analytical workloads and design report for best performance
